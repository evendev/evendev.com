I've just set up this site using [Harp][1] to generate a static copy. I love using Harp for static sites and for prototyping, but at this point for this website, I'm interested in seeing how easy it'll be to run a blog with Harp.

Hopefully it's a breeze. I'm hoping to find any kinks in the work flow early on and either iron them out or switch to a different platform.

There are so many benefits to publishing static websites. I'll be writing much more about this topic soon.

I'm not sure if I'll like having to store meta data in a separate file (`_data.json`) for blog posts. Many other static generators use YAML front matter to store meta data about individual articles directly within each article file. I like this since it makes the article portable and self-contained, and you can easily review the current meta data while you're editing the article.

I certainly see the value of storing meta data in a separate `_data.json` file for all other uses, though. It helps keep the layouts and partial templates nice and clean and promotes a strong separation between presentation and meta data.

Optimistic. We'll see how this goes.
