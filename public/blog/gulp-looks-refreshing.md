While I love using [Grunt][1] for automating stuff, there's a new guy on the block called [gulp][2]. Though gulp isn't fully ready to replace grunt, it's quickly gaining steam.

Gulp prefers code over configuration, which is excellent news to me. Gruntfiles are usually very long and not much fun to dig through, and gulp helps alleviate this. Sure, a gulpfile will also be long, but the whole file is code and not configuration. In other words, each piece of the gulpfile performs work (if you run the task).

The syntax is comfortable to anyone that uses node.js and to anyone that's worked with Grunt. I'm looking forward to gulp's future.
