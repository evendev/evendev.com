[GitHub][3] released some beta invites to their new text editor, [Atom][1]. Some thoughts from my first five minutes with Atom:

## Markdown Preview!

I'm writing this markdown file directly in an [Atom][1] window. I love that
they've integrated a markdown preview right here in the editor (`Cmd + Shift + p` > Markdown Preview)! I usually use [Mou][2] for that, but it's much quicker to use my main text editor, since it's always open.

## Based on web technologies

This is one awesome thing about Atom: It's based on web technologies. In fact the editor itself is HTML and CSS. You can inspect the app itself using the familiar web inspector (`Cmd + Opt + i`).

## A little slower than Sublime Text

It seems a little bit slower than Sublime Text, which I've been using for years. It's just a little less responsive, a slight lag between a keystroke and seeing the character in the editor. Minimal but it's there.

## Familiar to the Sublime Text user

Lots of the same commands from Sublime Text work in Atom. This will help make the switch much easier. I'm pretty sure this is intentional, which is just fine by me.

## Overall

So far so good. I like it. Looking forward to using it more over the next few weeks.
